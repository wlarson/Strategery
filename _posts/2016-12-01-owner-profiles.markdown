Fantasy football is a mix of team building and roster setting.  For this post I'll focus on team building.  

Team building starts with your draft and continues with trades, waivers, and free agent pick ups.  Nail the draft and you can get away with minimal other activity.  Miss in the draft and you'll need to be aggressive with week to week roster changes.

Here are some of owner profiles:

<b>High Risk, High Reward</b><br>
Bets big on rookies and key handcuffs.  Tends to reach on sleepers.  Drafts too many rookies, cutting most of them by mid-season.

<b>Value Investor</b><br>
Has one or more draft guides and follows it closely, consistently taking the best player available.  This strategy tends to result in the best overall roster, but not the best starting lineup.  Overvalues past performance.

<b>Buy & Hold</b><br>
Rarely makes trades or roster moves.  Often a good drafter, but sticks too long to pre-draft rankings and fails to adjust value for in-season performance.

<b>High Frequency Trader</b><br>
All over the waiver wire and free agents.  First to take action on injury updates and other roster updates. 

<b>Trade Spammer</b><br>
Rapid fires terrible trade offers to all other owners, hoping someone will accept a bad offer.  Example #1:  trying to trade pothead Josh Gordon for an actual NFL player.  Example #2:  trying to offer 2-3 good players for 1 elite player.  Frequent target of trade vetos.

<b>Asleep At The Wheel</b><br>
Goes AWOL after draft day.  May not even show up for the draft.

So, which profile do you fit?  The key is to mix and match a bit.
