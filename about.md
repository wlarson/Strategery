This site is devoted to the strategy side of Fantasy Football.  This assumes you are playing to win and not purely for social reasons.  There's nothing wrong with playing for fun!  But if you want to win, you need to have a plan.  As John Wooden once said, "Failure to prepare is preparing to fail."  So I suggest you prepare.  Prepare to win.
